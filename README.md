Initial code was refactored to increase accessibility. This was done by adding alt tags to each image, updating the title, and organizing the element structure. Efficiency was improved by consolidating CSS and implementing semantic HTML. These changes allow for long-term sustainability as well as the desired increase in accessibility.
